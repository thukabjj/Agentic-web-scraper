## Debugging Tips
- Enable debug logging: `export LOG_LEVEL=debug`

## Recovery Procedures

## STDIO/CLI Output Separation

- As of the latest update, all logs and status messages (such as initialization, adapter loading, etc.) are printed to **stderr**.
- Only valid JSON responses are printed to **stdout** in STDIO mode.
- This ensures compatibility with AI assistants and automated tools, and all protocol tests now pass.
